            <h1>Perimeter of square</h1>
            <p>
              The perimeter of a square is defined as the total length that its
              boundary covers. The perimeter of any closed geometrical object is
              calculated by finding the distance around that object. For a
              square, the perimeter can be calculated by finding the sum of all
              the sides. Let us have a look at the article in order to
              understand the concept in a better way.
            </p>
            <h2>What is the Perimeter of Square?</h2>
            <p>
              A perimeter of any shape is either a path that
              encompasses/surrounds/outlines a shape (in two dimensions) or its
              length (one-dimensional). The perimeter of a square can be
              calculated by adding the length of all its sides.
            </p>

              In the above section, we covered the definition of area of square
              as well as area of square formula. In this section let us
              understand how to use the area of the square formula to find its
              area with the help of few applications or real-world examples.

            <h2>What is a area of the square</h2>
            <p>
              A square is a closed two-dimensional shape with four equal sides
              and four equal angles. The four sides of the square form the four
              angles at the vertices. The sum of the total length of the sides
              of a square is its perimeter, and the total space occupied by the
              square is the area of the square. It is a quadrilateral with the
              following properties.

            <p>
              The perimeter of any two-dimensional figure is defined as the
              distance around the figure. We can calculate the perimeter of any
              closed shape just adding up the length of each of the sides. In
              this article, you will first learn about what is the perimeter,
              how to find the perimeter of different types of triangles when all
              side lengths are known. Furthermore, the solved examples will help
              you to get more views on the topic.
            </p>
            <h2>What is the Perimeter of Triangle?</h2>
            <p>
              The sum of the lengths of the sides is the perimeter of any
              polygon. In the case of a triangle, Perimeter = Sum of the three
              sides Always include units in the final answer. If the sides of
              the triangle are measured in centimetres, then the final answer
              should also be in centimetres.

            <h1>Area of the Triangle</h1>
            <p>
              The area of a triangle is defined as the total space occupied by
              the three sides of a triangle in a 2-dimensional plane. The basic
              formula for the area of a triangle is equal to half the product of
              its base and height, i.e., A = 1/2 × b × h.

            <h2>What is a area of the Triangle</h2>
            <p>
              The area of a triangle is the region enclosed between the sides of
              the triangle. Depending on the length of the sides and the
              internal angles, the area of a triangle varies from one triangle
              to another. The unit of area is measured in square units, for
              example, m2, cm2, in2, etc

              Perimeter is defined as the distance around a given area. Think of
              calculating how long a fence would be that completely surrounds
              your property. Perimeter is generally calculated by adding the
              lengths of all of the sides. Circles have no straight lines that
              are easily measured. Therefore, they require a special formula to
              determine perimeter.
            </p>
            <h2>What is the Perimeter of circle?</h2>
            <p>
              Learn that the perimeter of a circle has its own special name,
              called "circumference." The symbol is a capital C. It is
              calculated using the formula Pi x diameter, or 3.14 x d = C. It
              can also be calculated by Pi x (2 x radius) = C or 3.14 x (2 x r)
              = C

            <h1>Area of the circle</h1>
            <p>
              The area of a circle is the space occupied by the circle in a two-dimensional plane. Alternatively, the space occupied within the boundary/circumference of a circle is called the area of the circle.

            <h2>What is a area of the circle</h2>
            <p>
              The area of a circle is the amount of space enclosed within the boundary of a circle. The region within the boundary of the circle is the area occupied by the circle. It may also be referred to as the total number of square units inside that circle.            </p>
